# MonocularDepthEstimation
This repository contains the Tensorflow implementation for a Monocular Depth Estimator.

## Introduction:

Depth Estimation is one of the fundamental and most challenging task in Computer Vision; that has a wide range of applications like scene understanding, scene reconstruction(2D to 3D), virtual and augumented reality, robotics, autonomous vehicles and many more.

In general there are two ways in which this task is achieved:-
  1. Multi-source method.
  2. Single-source or Monocular-source method.

### Multi-source method:
Most of the work related to depth estimation has been traditionally done taking inputs from multiple sources and 

### Single/Monocular-source method:
